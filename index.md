## About Me
My name is Sungyong Seo ([CV](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~sungyons/CV_SungyongSeo.pdf)) and I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of University of Southern California. I work on Machine Learning under supervision of [Prof. Yan Liu](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/).

I am interested in machine learning problems in general. More specifically, my research mainly focuses on principled techniques for extracting knowledge from the complex structures or networks and using it to build predictive models – in that way merging insights both from data mining and machine learning. Furthermore, combining the structural knowledge with temporal behaviors is the topic which I am interested in. I am working on the following topics:

- Spatiotemporal data mining
- Graph-based models
- Time Series Forecasting
